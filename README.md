# Data-Structures-112

Projects I worked on in Data Structures 112 (Rutgers University). For most of the projects, we had to fill in particular methods with the correct code for the program to run properly. 

Expression Evaluation:
  The Expression Evaluator outputs the solution of a mathematical expression consisting of predfined constants, variables, and arrays. 

Little Search Engine: 
  The Little Search Engine implements a Hash Table to output the frequency of each word in one or more text files. The output does not       print out noise words (the,is,a, etc.), which you can speciy beforehand.
